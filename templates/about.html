          Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung primarily affecting
          the small air sacs known as alveoli. Symptoms typically include some
          combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and
          difficulty breathing. The severity of the condition is
          variable.Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or
          bacteria, and less commonly by other microorganisms. Identifying the
          responsible pathogen can be difficult. Diagnosis is often based on
          symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-rays, blood tests, and
          culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis.The disease may
          be classified by where it was acquired, such as community- or
          hospital-acquired or healthcare-associated pneumonia.

          <h3>
            In adults, viruses account for about one third of pneumonia cases,
            and in children for about 15% of them. Commonly implicated agents
            include rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza virus, respiratory
            syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and parainfluenza. Herpes simplex
            virus rarely causes pneumonia, except in groups such as newborns,
            persons with cancer, transplant recipients, and people with
            significant burns. After organ transplantation or in otherwise
            immunocompromised persons, there are high rates of cytomegalovirus
            pneumonia.

            Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both
            lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material),
            causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty
            breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and
            fungi, can cause pneumonia.
